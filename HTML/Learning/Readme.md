Welcome to the HTML section of my frontend journey! This directory serves as the starting point for all my HTML-related work, from foundational concepts to practical examples.

## What's Inside?

This section is organized to track my learning progress systematically.

### ‚û°Ô∏è Learning

This sub-directory contains all my practice files, where each file corresponds to a specific topic in HTML. The code is well-commented and structured for easy understanding.

### üìö Topics Covered in the Learning Folder:

My learning is structured topic-by-topic, as seen in the files:

1.  **Basic Document Structure** 
2.  **Text Formatting** 
3.  **Lists (Ordered & Unordered)** 
4.  **Links & Images** 
5.  **Tables** 
6.  **Forms & Inputs** 
7.  **Semantic HTML5 Elements** 
8.  **Multimedia (Audio & Video)**

## üöÄ How to View These Files

The great thing about HTML is that you don't need a compiler!

1.  Clone this repository to your local machine.
2.  Navigate to the `HTML/Learning/` directory.
3.  **Simply open any `.html` file in your web browser** (like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge) to see the rendered output.

This folder will grow as I continue to explore more advanced HTML features.

**Happy Exploring!** ‚ú®
